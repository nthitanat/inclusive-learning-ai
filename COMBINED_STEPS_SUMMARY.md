# Combined Steps Implementation Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. ConfigModal Component Updates

**File**: `src/components/ConfigModal.tsx`

- **Updated `stepConfigFields`**: Reduced from 4 steps to 2 combined steps:
  - Step 0: Basic curriculum input (subject, lesson topic, level)
  - Step 1: Student details (number of students, student types, study period)
  
- **Added Tabbed Interface**: When multiple responses are available, tabs are displayed to switch between:
  - "ข้อมูลหลักสูตร" (Curriculum Data)
  - "จุดประสงค์การเรียนรู้" (Learning Objectives) 
  - "แผนการเรียนรู้" (Lesson Plan)
  - "การประเมินผล" (Evaluation)

- **Updated Props**: Changed `response: string` to `responses: { [key: string]: string }` to support multiple outputs

- **Updated Feedback**: Combined feedback from steps 2 & 3 into step 1 feedback that covers both lesson planning and evaluation aspects

### 2. Session Page Updates

**File**: `src/app/session/page.tsx`

- **Updated State Management**: Changed `configResponse` from string to object to handle multiple responses
- **Updated Handler Functions**:
  - `handleConfigStepSubmit`: Now calls combined API endpoints (`/api/chat/step/combined-0` or `/api/chat/step/combined-1`)
  - `handleFeedbackSubmit`: Simplified to only handle step 1 feedback
  - Fixed all response state management to work with new object structure

### 3. API Route Updates

**File**: `src/app/api/chat/step/[configStep]/route.ts`

- **Added Combined Endpoints**:
  - `combined-0`: Runs curriculum analysis (step 0) + objectives generation (step 1) sequentially
  - `combined-1`: Runs lesson planning (step 2) + evaluation generation (step 3) sequentially
  
- **Maintained Backward Compatibility**: All original individual step endpoints (0, 1, 2, 3) still work

- **Updated Response Format**: Combined endpoints return `{ responses: { [key: string]: any } }` instead of single response

## User Experience Improvements

### Before (4 Steps)
1. Enter curriculum info → See curriculum analysis
2. No input → See learning objectives  
3. Enter student details → See lesson plan
4. No input → See evaluation

### After (2 Combined Steps)
1. **Step 1**: Enter curriculum info → See curriculum analysis + learning objectives in tabs
2. **Step 2**: Enter student details → See lesson plan + evaluation in tabs

## Benefits

1. **Reduced Clicks**: From 4 steps to 2 steps
2. **Better Information Architecture**: Related outputs are grouped together
3. **Improved UX**: Tabbed interface allows easy switching between related content
4. **Maintained Functionality**: All original features preserved
5. **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy API endpoints still work
6. **Enhanced Feedback**: Combined feedback covers all aspects in one step

## Technical Implementation

- **Sequential Processing**: Currently runs combined operations sequentially for stability
- **Future Optimization**: Can be enhanced with parallel processing using existing `runParallelSteps` method
- **Error Handling**: Maintained all existing error handling patterns
- **Performance**: Slight improvement due to reduced API calls and state management

## Testing

The application is now running at http://localhost:3000/session and ready for testing. The combined workflow should provide a smoother user experience while maintaining all the original AI-powered lesson planning capabilities.
